## üëã About Me
As a software developer, I possess a wide range of technical skills that allow me to build robust and efficient applications that meet the needs of my clients. I have a passion for learning new technologies and building cool projects, and I have experience working in a variety of roles, including DevOps Engineer, System Administrator, Programmer, Frontend Developer, Backend Developer, and video game developer.

I am highly proficient in languages such as C#, C++, Python, TypeScript and SQL, and have experience using framework .NET. I am also skilled in front-end development, with a strong understanding of HTML and CSS, as well as experience working with popular front-end libraries such as Bootstrap.

In addition to my technical skills, I have a strong understanding of analytics and can easily analyze any given task to come up with a plan to automate any project and eliminate unnecessary elements. I am an extremely stress-resistant person and do not show my weakness easily, making me well-suited for high-pressure environments. I am not impulsive and consider myself a very serious and responsible person, always following the given task strictly, as I believe that a job well done is a job that is done 100%.

Furthermore, I have experience and knowledge in working with various types of graphs such as ER diagrams, BPMN, and IDEF0. I am able to use these tools to model complex systems and analyze data flows. I also have proficiency in using Loginom, a powerful data analysis and visualization tool to extract insights from large datasets and create custom reports and dashboards.

Overall, my technical expertise, analytical skills, and experience with data visualization tools make me well-suited for a variety of software development roles, particularly those that involve complex data analysis and visualization. I am also particularly interested in video game development and have experience working on game projects in the past.
